# Locomotive Request

## Summary

Derail Valley modding allowing locomotives to be summoned to nearby locomotive parking tracks.

## Description

In vanilla career mode, the only way to get a specific locomotive at a station which doesn't already exist is to clear or move the existing locomotive(s), move outside of spawn range, and reenter, forcing the game to spawn new locomotives and rerolling your chances to receive the desired locomotive.

If you prefer to use specific locomotives for specific tasks, this can get pretty tedious, and also risks removing existing jobs at the station if you move too far away. This mod provides an alternate way of acquiring locomotives without requiring the use of the comms radio spawn mode.
